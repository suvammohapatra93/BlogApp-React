Job Application App
This project is a modern frontend web application built with React and Vite, designed to manage job applications. The app uses Tailwind CSS for styling and integrates with Appwrite for backend services. Additional libraries like Redux Toolkit, React Router, React Hook Form, and TinyMCE provide state management, routing, form handling, and rich text editing functionalities.

Features
React and Vite: A fast and efficient build tool and framework.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for responsive design.
Appwrite Integration: Backend as a Service (BaaS) platform for managing the backend.
Redux Toolkit: For state management across the application.
React Router DOM: For navigation and routing between pages.
React Hook Form: Simplified form management and validation.
TinyMCE: Rich text editor for content creation.
HTML React Parser: Converts HTML strings to React components.
